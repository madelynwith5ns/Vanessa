Vanessa is a semi-opinionated, dependency-free, threading and utility library
for Rust programs.

-- Cargo features --
multilog: Enabling this causes Vanessa's logger to store its current log file
in the logs/latest.log file instead of simply latest.log and store old logs
alongside them in the logs directory.
